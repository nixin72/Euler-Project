# Euler-Project

Decided to start this project at a time where I knew very little math. I'd taken a linear algebra course and a single class in basic discrete math. I decided it would be a fun challenge, although now with having taken much more math, I'm interested in potentially reviving my work on this... I just have too much other stuff on the go.
